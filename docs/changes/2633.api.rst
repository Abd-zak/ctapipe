Move the simulated shower distribution from something
that was specific to ``SimTelEventSource`` to a general interface
of ``EventSource``. Implement the new interface in both ``SimTelEventSource``
and ``HDF5EventSource`` and adapt writing of this information in ``DataWriter``.

This makes sure that the ``SimulatedShowerDistribution`` information is always
included, also when running ``ctapipe-process`` consecutively.
