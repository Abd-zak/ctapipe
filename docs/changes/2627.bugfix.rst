Fix that hdf5 files created with older versions of ctapipe, e.g.
the public dataset created with 0.17 can be read by ctapipe-process.
These files are missing the subarray reference location, which was
introduced in later versions of ctapipe. A dummy location (lon=0, lat=0)
is used for these now, the same value is already used for simtel files
lacking this information.
