Fix error in ``ctapipe-process`` when in the middle of a simtel file
that has true images available, a telescope event is missing the true image.
This can happen rarely in case a telescope triggered on pure NSB or
is oversaturated to the point where the true pe didn't fit into memory constraints.

The error was due to the ``DataWriter`` trying to write a ``None`` into an
already setup table for the true images.

The ``SimTelEventSource`` will now create an invalid true image filled with ``-1``
for such events.
