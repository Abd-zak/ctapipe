Add possibility to use ``HIPPARCOS`` catalog to get star positions

- add catalogs enumerator to ``ctapipe.utils.astro``
- update ``get_bright_stars`` in ``ctapipe.utils.astro`` to allow catalog selection
- ensure application of proper motion
- add possibility to select stars on proximit to a given position and on apparent magnitude
- move cached star catalogs to ``ctapipe/resources/``
- API change: ``ctapipe.utils.astro.get_bright_stars`` now requires a timestamp to apply proper motion.
  In the prevision revision, the time argument was missing and the proper motion was not applied.
