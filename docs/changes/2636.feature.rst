Update ``CameraCalibrator`` in ``ctapipe.calib.camera.calibrator`` allowing it to correctly calibrate variance images generated with the ``VarianceExtractor``.
  - If the VarianceExtractor is used for the ``CameraCalibrator`` the element-wise square of the relative and absolute gain calibration factors are applied to the image;
  - For other image extractors the plain factors are still applied.
